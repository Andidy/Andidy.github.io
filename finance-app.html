  <p>finance-app is a project to create an application which allows a user to input financial events
     the app will then project those events into the future allowing the user to see how their wealth
     will grow or shrink over time.
     <br>
     It is also a project for me to refresh my C# knowledge, learn XAML and WPF, and famaliarize myself
     with new technologies, architectures, and design patterns.
