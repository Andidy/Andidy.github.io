title: Engine: My decision on the structure of the engine
---

The main thing that had been pushing me towards the idea of refactoring engine was that I couldn't figure out how to get the
viewport data into the game layer in order to perform object picking, that I needed the input structure in the universal
layer, and just a general feeling that the codebase was cluttered. I designed a new structure of the code base shown below
and spent some time thinking about it. I was fairly sure I was going to go through with the decision to move the game state,
renderer, and potentially more "modules" into global space in order to allow easy access to all the state from anywhere.

I mentioned this in the last blog post though I didn't go into any details. In the mean time, I hadn't had much energy to work on my codebase because sheet metal work is exhausting. So, I asked around some programming discords that I am in what
people thought of my issue. Someone suggested just putting the viewport data into the game's camera struct. Technically this
does duplicate data because the renderer viewport will normally be the same as the game camera viewport. However, the
renderer viewport is actually a dependency of the game camera viewport. When rendering the game scene, the game camera
viewport is the viewport the renderer will obey. I believe updating the renderer viewport is also a fairly cheap operation
because I asked in the DirectX discord and one of the Microsoft developers in their said: "Just call RSSetViewports as often as you need". I believe that the optimal strategy is to update the game camera viewport and when I call my rendering
functions in the main loop, I will send through the viewport information to the renderer so it can update the viewport for
drawing the game scene.

So, I implemented the viewport into the game camera struct and finished implementing object picking and, aside from some bugs
with the math, everything went smoothly. This implies that the current structure isn't actually that bad. I just need to
spend more time on engine and refamiliarize myself with the code base since I had spent a few months working on my project
"frontier" between when I was last regularly working on engine, and now. I think I won't do a major refactor and instead just
do small cleanups around the codebase instead while I refamiliarize myself with it.

With object picking implemented, my next goals are to properly handle resizing the window, adding more robust asset loading
code for the 3D models and their meshes, normal maps, textures, etc., and then continuing with adding features to the
renderer like normal maps, bump maps, mipmaps, anti-aliasing, filtering, etc.
