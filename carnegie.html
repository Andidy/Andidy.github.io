  <p>Carnegie was an attempt to learn the D3D12 API while working on making a 2D tilemap system.
  Though I completed most of my goals for the project, I realized I was trying to learn too much at once,
  (D3D12, known graphics techniques, my own graphics technique, making a platform layer, making game systems),
  this lead to a lack of direction and my code base had become too difficult to manage. I decided I would take
  the lessons I learned from this project and simplify the parts that were needlessly complex for what I was trying
  to do and trim down a bunch of the rough edges to have a clean slate but I could also reuse some of the work I had
  done to start on a new project. You can find a more thorough write-up in the Github README linked above.
