    <h2>Inactive Projects:</h2>
    <p>These are the projects that are inactive or abandoned:</p>
    
    <h3>Carnegie (Abandoned)</h3>
    <p>A 2D tilemap renderer using D3D12 (Mostly complete but, Abandoned) <a href="https://github.com/Andidy/carnegie">GitHub</a><br><img src="/docs/assets/images/carnegie.png" alt="An image of progress adding animations and layers."></p>
    
    <h3>Frontier (Inactive)</h3>
    <p>Frontier is a software rendered 2D city building game. <a href="github.com/Andidy/frontier">Github</a><br>
      <img src="/docs/assets/images/frontier/buildings.png" alt="An image of the game with various buildings constructed."><br>
      It features a number of building types all moddable by accessing the building template JSON file. 
      Buildings can produce resources and consume resources during the process to create production chains (Wheat Farm -> Mill -> Bakery and Orchard -> Brewery being examples).<br>
      An example building template for the wheat field:<br>
      
{% highlight json %}
{
  "_name": "Field",
  "ENUM": 2,
  "RESOURCE_INPUT": [
    [ 0, 0 ]
  ],
  "RESOURCE_OUTPUT": [
    [ 1, 5 ]
  ],
  "PRODUCTION_TICKS": 10,
  "RESOURCES_COST_TO_BUILD": [ [ 4, 1 ] ],
  "TICKS_TO_BUILD": 5
} {% endhighlight %}
      
      There are units which can be selected and moved around the map with a basic pathfinding algorithm. The units have a basic attack and can be ordered to damage
      another unit when next to it.<br>
      <img src="/docs/assets/images/frontier/basic_pathing.png" alt="An image of basic pathfinding for a unit."><br>
      The UI and game map are rendered seperately with the game map supporting panning and scaling from 1x to 8x. Animation is supported.<br>
      The game map rendering is tile based and so in order to improve visual fidelity I implemented Wang-Blob tiles so that borders between different terrain types
      would have interesting graphics. I also implemented sub-tile variance using blue noise so that even when two adjacent tiles have the same Wang-Blob tile type
      they are likely to have a different set of the four sub-tiles that make up a full game map tile. Compare the grass textures in the following:<br>

      <img src="/docs/assets/images/frontier/wang_blob_tiles.png" alt="An image showing how Wang Blob tiles improves the look of terrain borders.">
      <img src="/docs/assets/images/frontier/wang_blob_with_variants.png" alt="An image of Wang Blob with sub tile variants for maximum fidelity.">
      <br>
      Frontier features keyboard and mouse support and a basic UI with simple buttons, panels, and bitmap based text.<br>
      Frontier is in active because I am more interested in 3D graphics (See Engine) right now.
