    <h2>Projects:</h2>
    <p>These are the projects I'm actively working on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>3D Renderer (Rasterization)</li>
      <li>finance-app</li>
      <li>ady_math, A Vector Math Library for C and C++</li>
      <li>This Website :)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are the projects that are inactive or abandoned:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Frontier, A 2D software rendered city building game. (Inactive)<img src="/docs/assets/images/buildings.png" alt="An image of the game with various buildings constructed."></li>
      <li>Carnegie, A 2D tilemap renderer using D3D12 (Mostly complete but, Abandoned)<img src="/docs/assets/images/carnegie.png" alt="An image of progress adding animations and layers."></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Frontier (Inactive)</h3>
    <p>Frontier is a software rendered 2D city building game.<br>
      <img src="/docs/assets/images/buildings.png" alt="An image of the game with various buildings constructed."><br>
      It features a number of building types all moddable by accessing the building template JSON file. 
      Buildings can produce resources and consume resources during the process to create production chains (Wheat Farm -> Mill -> Bakery and Orchard -> Brewery being examples).<br>
      
      <br>
      A badly formatted example building template while I figure out syntax highlighting for github-pages:<br>
      
      {% highlight json %}
      
      {
        "_name": "Field",
        "ENUM": 2,
        "RESOURCE_INPUT": [
          [ 0, 0 ]
        ],
        "RESOURCE_OUTPUT": [
          [ 1, 5 ]
        ],
        "PRODUCTION_TICKS": 10,
        "RESOURCES_COST_TO_BUILD": [ [ 4, 1 ] ],
        "TICKS_TO_BUILD": 5
      }
      
      {% endhighlight %}
      
      <br>
      There are units which can be selected and moved around the map with a basic pathfinding algorithm. The units have a basic attack and can be ordered to damage
      another unit when next to it.<br>
      The UI and game map are rendered seperately with the game map supporting panning and scaling from 1x to 8x. Animation is supported.<br>
      The game map rendering is tile based and so in order to improve visual fidelity I implemented Wang-Blob tiles so that borders between different terrain types
      would have interesting graphics. I also implemented sub-tile variance using blue noise so that even when two adjacent tiles have the same Wang-Blob tile type
      they are likely to have a different set of the four sub-tiles that make up a full game map tile.<br>
      Frontier features keyboard and mouse support and a basic UI with simple buttons, panels, and bitmap based text.<br>
      Frontier is in active because I am more interested in 3D graphics (See Engine) right now.
